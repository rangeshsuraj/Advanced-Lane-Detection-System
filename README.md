# Advanced-Lane-Detection-System
OBJECTIVE: An advanced driver assistance technology, lane detection systems identify and track road lane markings, enhancing vehicle safety by alerting drivers to unintended lane departures using computer vision and machine learning algorithms.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF TECHNIQUES:
-Lane detection systems employ a combination of camera calibration, perspective transformation, and thresholding techniques. 
-Initially, camera calibration corrects lens distortions for accurate image capture.
-Perspective transformation is applied to obtain a bird’s-eye view of the road, simplifying lane identification.
-Thresholding techniques highlight lane markings by isolating specific color and gradient features.
-Finally, advanced algorithms like sliding window or convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used to detect and track lane lines, ensuring continuous monitoring and real-time response.
-The system integrates these processed images back into the vehicle’s original viewpoint, overlaying lane information to assist the driver.

A lane detection system is an advanced driver assistance technology designed to identify and track lane markings on roads, enhancing vehicle safety by alerting drivers to unintended lane departures. The system utilizes computer vision and machine learning algorithms to process real-time video footage, ensuring accurate and robust lane detection under various driving conditions.

ADVANTAGES:
-Enhanced Safety: Reduces the risk of accidents by alerting drivers to lane departures.
-Driver Assistance: Assists in maintaining proper lane discipline, especially on highways.
-Autonomous Driving: Integral to self-driving car technology, contributing to autonomous navigation.

FUTURE SCOPE AND ENHANCEMENTS:
The future of lane detection systems includes integration with other vehicle sensors (such as LIDAR and RADAR) to enhance accuracy and reliability. Advancements in AI and machine learning can further improve system robustness, enabling lane detection under adverse weather conditions and on poorly marked roads. Additionally, the incorporation of V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) communication can enhance lane detection by utilizing real-time data from other vehicles and infrastructure.
